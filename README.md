# BlockCraft
### ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### Running a Local Client

To get the client up and running, follow these steps. A fresh install is recommended to avoid any "Module not found" errors, as the project relies on specific versions of the `three.js` library.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ChiefElite/blockcraft-public.git](https://github.com/ChiefElite/blockcraft-public.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the client folder:**
    ```bash
    cd blockcraft-public/client
    ```

3.  **Run the client:**
    ```bash
    npm install three
npm install
    npm start
    ```
    The client will be available at `http://localhost:3001` by default.
